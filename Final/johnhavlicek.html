        <p>Why He Was Important?</p>
    </h1>John Havlicek, dubbed with the nickname “Hondo,” is one of the most legendary players in NBA and Boston Celtics history. He played all 16 of his NBA seasons in Boston and took home the championship in eight of them. Standing two rings shy of owning one for every finger, Havlicek is the third-winningest player in NBA history.
